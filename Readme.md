# our thoughts
There has never been a website framework like Wordpress in Python, so I DIY one

The goal is to allow users to write websites by writing plug-ins, batteries, and themes without modifying the kernel code.

Creativity: The battery is a pre-written web page frame (frame in the frame) to speed up the writing speed

Welcome everyone to write plug-in battery themes for Illumine!
